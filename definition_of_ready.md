Business value is clearly understood by the team (why). 

Details are sufficiently understood by the team so it can make an informed decision as to whether it can complete the PBI (the developer knows how to implement the feature) (how). 

Dependencies are identified and no external dependencies would block the PBI from being completed. (we can actually work on it) 

The PBI is estimated and small enough to comfortably be completed in one sprint. 

Acceptance criteria is clear and testable
